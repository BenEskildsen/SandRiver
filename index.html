What will we do on the day the grocery stores stop having food on the shelves?  Will we dig deeper trenches?  Or will we set the table with everything we have left and invite the whole neighborhood over for dinner?
          </p>
          <p>
You could read these as questions of human nature.  Are humans inherently greedy or generous?  Or you could read them as questions of custom and practice.  Once we allow land and food to become commodities, how long before we lose our ability to see anything else?
          </p>

At Sand River Community Farm, we are stubbornly unwilling to give up on humans.  And hopelessly in love with the possibility that it hasn’t always been this way.

          How would we farm and feed one another if land and food weren’t for sale?
          </p>
          <p>
Imagine for a moment that the steady creep of the market into our woodlands, farm fields, lakes and rivers, our neighborhoods, households and even our families, has robbed our ability to remember our deeply human generosity?  Our capacity to feed one another?  Our capacity to neighbor?
          </p>
          <p><i>How might we go about remembering?</i></p>

At Sand River Community Farm, we grow and glean, preserve and serve food as a gift to anyone who is hungry for any reason.
          </p>

          But our work isn’t charitable, at least in the way that word is commonly used.  We search for old patterns of neighborly care in the falling-down barns and abandoned farm fields, by tracing our finger along the spine of an old stone wall running through the woods.  The work of the Farm attempts to set a bountiful table and invite the whole neighborhood to supper, asking the oldest among us: “How did we feed one another before everything had a price tag on it?  Before the grocery store arrived in town?  Before everything came from somewhere else?  Before we were consumers?
          </p>

            <i>How did we neighbor back then?”</i>

You could call Sand River Community Farm a burgeoning agricultural gift economy, but the words risk sounding a bit grandiose.
          </p>

  Instead, you might notice that it is still socially taboo to invite your neighbor over for dinner and then hand them a bill.  In reverse, it would be rude to take out your wallet and give your host a hundred-dollar bill after enjoying a generous meal.  A home is one of the only remaining places where food isn’t for sale.  With that in mind, we make the following, humble proclamation:
          </p>

 “Sand River Community Farm sings a love song for home in a displaced time.”
